# E-Commerce

I have developed a Console-Based E-Commerce Website for sellers, customers, and users. Sellers can effortlessly list and sell their products on the store, while Users can register and log in to access a personalized experience. Customers enjoy the convenience of adding products to their cart or wishlist, placing orders, and tracking order details. Additionally, I've integrated product categories, allowing sellers to organize their products effectively.
